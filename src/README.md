# Source Directory (`src/`)

This directory contains the main source code for the EduAi application. It follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns.

## Directory Structure

- `components/`: Reusable UI components used across the application
- `pages/`: Role-based page components (admin, teacher, student views)
- `layouts/`: Layout components that define the structure for different user roles
- `api/`: API integration and service layer for backend communication
- `context/`: React context providers for state management
- `config/`: Configuration files and constants
- `utils/`: Utility functions and helper methods

## Key Files

- `App.tsx`: Main application component
- `main.tsx`: Application entry point
- `index.css`: Global styles
- `vite-env.d.ts`: TypeScript declarations for Vite

## Best Practices

1. Keep components modular and reusable
2. Follow the established folder structure
3. Maintain consistent naming conventions
4. Document complex logic and components
